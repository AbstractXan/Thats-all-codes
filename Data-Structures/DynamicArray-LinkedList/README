How to run the project:

$ make
$ ./phone

Files included in the project:
> Directory.h 	: Directory header file
> Directory.cpp : Contains all the functions for Directory ADT
> main.cpp	: For user interaction and inputs
> directory.txt : 

Logic:
Directory is a dynamic array of root node pointers and the root node pointers are further connected to data node linked list.

Salient features:
> Commit prompts are given to user such that commits/rollbacks are possible.
> Directory is a dynamic array. Thus extending array is easier.
